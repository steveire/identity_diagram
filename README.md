A simple drawing canvas for rectangles and squares

This is a small utility I made for a friend to help with a survey on unipark.de, open sourced so that the science can be done again.

The content of unipark-question.html can be pasted as a custom question, and canvas-renderer.html
can be used to visualize an individual result.
